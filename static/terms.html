    <p>
        <b>4. </b>
        <b>Account.</b>
        In order to use the Service, you have to create an account (“<b>Account</b>”). You must not allow anyone other than yourself or an End User to access and
        use your Account. You acknowledge and agree: (i) to provide accurate and complete Account and login information; (ii) to keep, and ensure that End Users
        keep, all Account login details and passwords secure at all times; (iii) to remain solely responsible and liable for the activity that occurs in connection

        details; and (v) to promptly notify PeerSay in writing if you become aware of any unauthorized access or use of your Account or the Service. You may cancel
        your Account at any time by using the tools that we make available within the Service or by sending a cancellation request to us at

        time.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>5. </b>
        <b>Fees</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        5.1. Your access to and use of the Service may be subject to up-front payment of the subscription fees, as set forth in the Order Form. You acknowledge
        that the subscription fee during any Renewal Term, if applicable and unless set forth otherwise in the Order Form, will be determined by PeerSay’s
        then-current subscription fees.
    </p>

    <p>
        5.2. If you purchase any of our paid Services (“<b>Premium Services</b>”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes. Failure to pay these fees may
        result in the termination of your subscription. In addition: (i) your purchase may be subject to additional fees, such as foreign exchange fees or
        differences in prices based on location; (ii) you authorize us to store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has
        expired, to avoid interruptions in your Premium Service (e.g. subscriptions) and to facilitate easy payment for new services; and (iii) you must pay us for
        applicable fees and taxes, unless you cancel the Premium Service, in which case you agree to still pay these fees through the end of the applicable
        subscription period. If you wish to cancel the Premium Services, you may do so at any time by using the tools that we make available within the Service or
        by sending a cancellation request to us at
        <a href="mailto:contact@peer-say.com">contact@peer-say.com</a>, in which case we will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to respond within a reasonable time.

    <p>
        <b>6. </b>
        <b>Our Privacy Policy.</b>
        You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service, including, without limitation, any information transmitted to or stored by PeerSay, is governed by

        improvements, and all related patent rights, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, related goodwill, including data related your usage
        thereof, and PeerSay’s intellectual property, and any rights therein not explicitly granted to you hereunder, are reserved to and shall remain solely and

        terminate your use of the Site; or (ii) the date that we receive payment of any applicable Service subscription fee (including for Premium Services), and
        shall continue until expiration of the subscription period (the “<b>Initial</b>
        <b>Term</b>”). Thereafter, subject to your payment of any applicable
        Service subscription fees, these Terms shall automatically renew for successive subscription periods (each a “<b>Renewal Term</b>”, and together with the
        Initial Term, the “<b>Term</b>”), or until these Terms are terminated in accordance with the Section herein entitled ‘<i>Termination</i>’. If you continue
        to use the Service past any subscription period renewal date, you shall be deemed to have renewed these Terms for the corresponding Renewal Term.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>9. </b>
        <b>Termination.</b>
        Without derogating from your obligation to pay the subscription fees, you may terminate these Terms at any time by cancelling your Account. We may stop to
        provide the Service (including the Premium Service) to you at any time, including without limitation in the event that you breach these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>10. </b>
        <b>Effect of Termination.</b>
        Upon termination of these Terms, you will lose all access to the Service and to any data that we may be storing on your behalf. It is your responsibility
        to download your data prior to canceling your Account or any termination of these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of thirty (30) days
        from the effective date of termination of these Terms we will provide you, upon your written request, with a reasonable opportunity to download your data
        at a time nominated by us. We reserve the right to permanently delete from our (or our third party service provider’s) servers any data that may be

        is deleted in connection thereto. Sections 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17 and 18 shall survive termination of these Terms.

        for the selection of the Service to achieve your intended results. PEERSAY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED,

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>12. </b>
        <b>Limitation of Liability.</b>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, PEERSAY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
        (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE) ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, EVEN IF
        PEERSAY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF PEERSAY FOR ANY DAMAGES UNDER THESE TERMS OR IN
        CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SUBSCRIPTION FEES PAID BY YOU FOR THE PREMIUM SERVICE, IF ANY,
        DURING THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRIOR TO BRINGING THE CLAIM.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>13. </b>
        <b>Indemnification.</b>
        You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless PeerSay and our affiliates and our respective officers, directors, agents, consultants and employees from

        investigate potential violations hereof; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) respond to your support

    <p>
        <b>16. </b>
        <b>Modifications.</b>
        We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Terms at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following our sending a notice
        thereof to you or posting the revised Terms on the Site, and your continued use of the Service thereafter means that you accept those changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>17. </b>
        <b>Governing Law and Disputes.</b>
        These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Israel, without reference to its conflict of laws rules. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for
        all disputes hereunder shall be the courts located in Tel Aviv, and each party hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, PeerSay reserves the right to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>18. </b>
        <b>General.</b>
        These Terms, and the Order Form and Privacy Policy, represent the complete agreement concerning the Service between you and PeerSay and supersede all prior
        agreements and representations related to the subject matter hereof. To the extent of any inconsistency or conflict between these Terms and an Order Form,
        these Terms shall prevail. Section headings are provided for convenience only and have no substantive effect on construction. Except for your obligation to
        pay PeerSay, neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control. Nothing herein shall be construed to
        create any employment relationship, partnership, joint venture or agency relationship or to authorize any party to enter into any commitment or agreement
        binding on the other party. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, these Terms shall be construed without such provision. The failure
        by a party to exercise any right hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of such party’s right to exercise such right or any other right in the future.
