## What's here?

This folder is not native to jQuery distribution. It is created by [pjitco@gmail.com](mailto:pjitco@gmail.com).

jQuery plugins that can not be installed by Bower should be placed here.

## Why?

To store them in one place and make it easy to check compatibility upon jQuery upgrade via Bower.
